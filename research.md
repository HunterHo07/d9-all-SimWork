   - Mimics natural movement and physics
   - Breaks away from rigid grid systems

3. **Holographic and Glassmorphism**
   - Transparent, frosted glass effects
   - Light refraction and prismatic color schemes
   - Creates depth without heaviness

4. **Cybernetic Minimalism**
   - Stripped down but with high-tech elements
   - Focused on function with futuristic aesthetics
   - Sparse layouts with dramatic focal points

5. **Data Physicalization**
   - Turning abstract data into tangible visual elements
   - 3D representations of information
   - Interactive data sculptures

### Animation and Interaction Paradigms

1. **Spatial Interfaces**
